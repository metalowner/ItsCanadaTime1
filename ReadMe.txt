Editing the landing page template guide:

All the websites are made of Html (Or Html5 nowadays).

So your first step will be editing the index.html file provided in the template in order to create your awesome landing page!

*I suggest you download Sublime Text 3 from here: https://www.sublimetext.com/3 in order to have an easy time editing.
	But you can use Text Document or an online editor.

Lets get started!

Open index.html with your editor of choice.

1. Locate <title>Canadin immigration service</title> and change the inside content into what you want to be written on the Window Tab of the browser.
	
	*For example: <title>Tab name here</title>
 
2. Locate <h1 id="headerH1">Easy immigration to Canada!</h1> And change the inside into whatever you want your header to be.

	*For example: <h1 id="headerH1">Your awesome header goes here!</h1>

3. Locate <pre id="paragraphText">
	Our immigration service is one of the best in the industry 
	helping thousands of people to immigrate to Canada every year 
	with our advenced technologies, dedicated staff and world 
	class experts...
	</pre>

	And edit your paragraph between the <pre></pre> tags.

	*For example: <pre id="paragraphText">Your unique paragraph content goes here!</pre>
		**It can also look like this:<pre id="paragraphText">
			Your unique 
				paragraph content 
					goes here!
			</pre> and will still work. Presenting the enters, tabs, etc.

4. Locate <p id="copyright">Copyright ©thewebsitename 2018 All Rights Reserved.​​​​​​​ </p> and change the websitename into your domain name.
	*For example: <p id="copyright">Copyright ©ItsCanadaTime 2018 All Rights Reserved.​​​​​​​ </p>

5. Locate   <!-- Page details for SEO purposes -->
  	<meta name="author" content="name">
  	<meta name="description" content="description here">
 	 <meta name="keywords" content="keywords,here">
And change the SEO of your landing page to what you think best describes it.
	*For example: <!-- Page details for SEO purposes -->
  		<meta name="author" content="Pavel Yudkevich">
  		<meta name="description" content="ItsCanadaTime landing page.">
 		 <meta name="keywords" content="itscanadatime,landing page,guide,html">

Thats it, your awesome responsive landing page is ready!
